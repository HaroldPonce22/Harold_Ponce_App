App Examples:

I would like to create an app called outfit editor and it would take in your height and weight and body type and suggest outfits based on your build. A hard implementation would be body recognition and measurment to store in a database that then compares your size to every clothing peice avaliable online. The comparison would be used to tell you what size clothing of different brands would fit you as long as its online. If a clothing brand is not in an accesible database they can be added manually then it would be included. The app will also be able to give you clothing stores and areas where you can likley find the peice youre looking for. These different implementations will be seperated by tab buttons that can be pressed on the bottom of the screen to keep UI managment small. The user can also slide left and right to change the tabs that would be in the order of outfits, stores, measure, find, and with a small tab in the top left corner that includes account information and the basics of app data orginization.

## Notes
The troubles i ran into were file location and storing because my repository was created in the wrong file and i had to create a new one.
Other than that the coding was straight forward.
